Gong's research focuses on magnetic, electronic and optical properties of two-dimensional materials, nanostructures and nanodevices, studied by optical and electrical approaches in synergy with density functional theory calculations. The fundamental physics and phenomena have significant application implications in data storage, sensors, energy and quantum technologies.

The HFS600 freezing and heating stage is used to adjust the environmental temperature of the two-dimensional material samples, testing their behaviors under extreme conditions. The [original product](https://www.linkam.co.uk/hfs600) places the samples at lower elevations, which experiences relatively less magnetic fields generated by the magnetic coils. For testing purposes, we wanted to place the samples in the middle of the magnetic coil for stonger magnetic fields. I was asked to design a new lid based of the original dimensions with higher stage.
